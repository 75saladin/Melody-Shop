For 1.1:
  - Refactor melody
  - Document code
  - Upload recordings
  - Merge 1.1 to master
  
=======
  
- Tree implementation of rhythm
- play script todos
- Use rhythm tree to play "plinko" to pick where notes start
- Abstract scales, chords, notes are the same thing: Tonic with pitch class members. They are only different when you rasterize them to a collection of pitches
- Unit tests
- Implement theory parsing player? Maybe a separate project using this as a module
