- Make song variables get grabbed from a config file, and copy the config file with each recording.
- Upload recordings
- Refactor melody
- make it print to a log file, make script read out log file after. That'll teach PYCMIX to intercept MY prints!
- Document code
- Make it take arguments: recording flag (edit README)
- Push code
- Tree implementation of rhythm
- Use rhythm tree to play "plinko" to pick where notes start
- Abstract scales, chords, notes are the same thing: Tonic with pitch class members. They are only different when you rasterize them to a collection of pitches
- Unit tests
- Implement theory parsing player? Maybe a separate project using this as a module
