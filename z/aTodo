For 1.0:
  - Fix no rtoutput bug
  - Refactor melody
  - make it print to a log file, make script read out log file after. That'll teach PYCMIX to intercept MY prints!
  - Document code
  - Make it take arguments: recording flag (edit README)
  - Upload recordings
  - Merge 1.0 to master
- Tree implementation of rhythm
- Use rhythm tree to play "plinko" to pick where notes start
- Abstract scales, chords, notes are the same thing: Tonic with pitch class members. They are only different when you rasterize them to a collection of pitches
- Unit tests
- Implement theory parsing player? Maybe a separate project using this as a module
